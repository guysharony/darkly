## htpasswd File

Upon visiting http://192.168.56.102/robots.txt, several files are found for exploration.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden
```

While navigating through /whatever, an htpasswd file is encountered. htpasswd is used for creating and maintaining text files where usernames and passwords for basic HTTP user authentication are stored.

```
root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49
```

Converting the root's password using MD5 yields qwerty123@.

This leads to the administrator login platform at http://192.168.56.102/admin.
